Bringing Technology Closer to Home: A Personalized Weather Tracker for Ogun State
A few months ago, I found myself constantly checking multiple weather apps, only to realize that none provided localized and reliable forecasts for cities in Ogun State, Nigeria. The general forecasts often felt inaccurate, and I knew there had to be a better way.
Thatâ€™s when I decided to build something tailored to my communityâ€”a weather tracking web app exclusively for Ogun State cities, including Abeokuta, Ijebu-Ode, Sagamu, Ilaro, Ota, Ifo, Iperu, and Ayetoro.
Using the MERN stack for development and Firebase for hosting, I built a frontend web application that delivers a 5-day weather forecast, tracking:
 âœ… Feels-like temperature
 âœ… Humidity levels
 âœ… Wind speed
 âœ… Air pressure
 âœ… Sunrise & sunset times
Technology has made it incredibly easy to create solutions that improve daily life. What once required extensive resources and infrastructure can now be built with the right tools and a passion for problem-solving.

Would love to hear your thoughtsâ€”how do you think localized tech solutions can impact our daily lives? ðŸš€
